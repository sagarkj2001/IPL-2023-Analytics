The Cricket Data Analytics🏏 project is made on IPL 2023 Data. I have used **Power BI** for making the Dashboard. We can easily analyse the data of the matches played in the world cup. We can also choose our best playing 11 from the pool of players playing the world cup. 

> To interact with the dashboard you can download the pbix file from the repository and open it in Power BI Desktop locally.
